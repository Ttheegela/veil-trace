# Shadow fleet: the tankers serving both Russia and Iran

Part of **Trace the Unseen** (Sanctions track, hackathon of 25 September 2026).

**Status: leads, not findings.** Everything in this folder is a research lead built in one
day from public sanctions lists, plus a small number of sponsor-data checks (Sayari) and
press or think-tank reports. Each lead says how solid it is. None of it is an accusation
against any company or ship, and none of it has been reviewed by a sanctions lawyer.

## The idea in one paragraph

A tanker has a seven-digit **IMO number** that is stamped on the hull and stays with it for
life. Its name, flag, owner and manager can all change. When we join the UK's Russia
sanctions list to the US Iran lists by IMO number, **42 tankers show up on both**. Many of
them go by different names on the two lists, and most are run by small, recently created
companies that manage one ship each. Following the name loses the ship; following the
hull number keeps it.

## What is in this folder

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) | The leads: the Russia and Iran overlap, who listed first, renamed hulls, young one-ship managers, two manager case studies, the EU July 2026 act, and the climate link |
| [METHOD.md](METHOD.md) | How to join lists by IMO number, the filter trap that moves the count from 42 to 54, and why matching by name fails |
| [../../tools/fleet/](../../tools/fleet/) | The three scripts that reproduce the counts from public list files you download yourself |

## Ground rules we followed

- **Companies are named only when they appear on an official US, UK, EU or UN list, or in an
  official government release**, with the list and date given. Firms we did not find on any
  of those lists are described in general terms ("an unlisted UAE firm"). No private
  individuals are named.
- **Ships are named** because every ship named here is on at least one official list.
- **No raw sponsor data is published.** Where we used Sayari records we give derived counts
  and dates and name the source.
- **Dates:** UK dates are the "Date Designated" field of the UK Sanctions List. US dates are
  the "first seen" dates in the OpenSanctions export of the US list. These matched the
  Treasury press releases on the two action days we checked (30 July 2025 and 15 April
  2026), but treat them as close to, not identical with, the official date.

## Innocent explanations to keep in mind

- Old tankers are sold and renamed often, for ordinary commercial reasons.
- Owning each ship through its own one-ship company is standard, legal practice in shipping.
- Manager names in list files and ship databases can be out of date.
- A record change on a listing day may be a data provider updating its file, not a real sale.
